The weight of unspoken words
A friendship that turns into rivalry
Healing from something you don’t talk about
The moment a single decision changes everything
Love that arrives too late
A world where memories are used as currency
A prophecy that everyone fears — except the one it’s about
Magic that slowly consumes the user
A kingdom where dreams influence reality
A creature that grants wishes at a terrible price
A friendship that starts in the most unexpected way
Two kids who can’t stand each other but have to work together
Learning to be brave even when no one is watching
Finding confidence in something you once feared
The moment you realize you’ve outgrown someone — or haven’t
Humans meeting their alternate-universe selves
A world where immortality was achieved — and regretted
A society where AI becomes the legal guardian of children
The forgotten planet that humanity abandoned
A time traveler stuck in the wrong era
The last diary entry before a historical tragedy
A rebellion hidden beneath everyday life
An unsent letter that could change a war
History rewritten by accident
A town where no one remembers the newcomer — except one person
The detective realizes they’re connected to every victim
Someone receives messages from their future self
A house that changes its layout every night
A crime solved, but the truth is worse than the lie
The ghost who just wants a friend
